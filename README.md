DRAG AND DROP FFMPEG ENCODER
STILL WORKING ON IT

Thanks to ffmpeg for existing!  
Drag and drop re-encoder for whatsapp web compatibility, ideally it takes any video that ffmpeg supports.
Using electron, fluent-ffmpeg and cheers-alert.
  
To run you need to download ffmpeg>0.9 and place it in the same dir as main.js and then run `npm install` and `npm start`.
